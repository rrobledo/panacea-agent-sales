## AI Process Guidelines

This project uses the **sparc-metodology** skill for AI interactions.

### SPARC Framework

When working on this project, follow the SPARC methodology:

1. **Specification** - Capture the goal, constraints, and success criteria in writing
2. **Pseudocode** - Sketch an explicit step-by-step plan before touching live systems
3. **Architecture** - Design the structure or tooling stack that best fits the plan
4. **Refinement** - Build and test in tight loops; fix issues before moving on
5. **Completion** - Reflect, document, run final security & quality checks, then hand over

This ensures disciplined, traceable, and reliable AI-assisted development.

### Stage Files

Each stage has a dedicated file in `.claude/sparc/`:

- [1-specification.md](.claude/sparc/1-specification.md)
- [2-pseudocode.md](.claude/sparc/2-pseudocode.md)
- [3-architecture.md](.claude/sparc/3-architecture.md)
- [4-refinement.md](.claude/sparc/4-refinement.md)
- [5-completion.md](.claude/sparc/5-completion.md)
